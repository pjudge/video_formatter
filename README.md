This small, custom D8 module provides a field formatter for entity reference fields (set to Remote Videos) to allow for videos to be lazy loaded.

The video thumbnail will load on the page with a "play button" icon over top. The embedded video itself won't load until the user clicks the thumbnail.

Currently only works with YouTube urls.
